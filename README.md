  Algorithms in Javascript :fire:
  
 </h1>
 
  
I strongly believe in **Learning in Public** that's why I've started actively maintaining this repo while practising **Datastrucutes and Algorithms** in Javascript.

At this point this repository is structured as below:

```
Algorithms
          Easy
          Medium
          Hard
Design Patterns
```

## Where I found these Algorithms ❓
I'm following **Hackerrank** roadmap and whenever I solve a problem there, I push the solution here as well. ➡️ [@hamzawaleed0102](https://www.hackerrank.com/hamzawaleed0102)


## Why learning in public? 🤩
An excerpt from a youtube video:

> I would highly encourage everyone to just put yourself out there and start sharing what you are learning. 
The way I think about it is, you are giving yourself a chance to get lucky.
You won't really be able to meet interesting people and have great outcomes. 
If you're sitting in the corner and coding all day, It's very hard to get noticed.


## Lack of motivation to get started with DSA? 🥱
Make small goals, at least solve one problem every day. Eventually you'll end up solving **365** problems a year, which is HUGE.

If you're procrastinating and thinking that you'll start doing it after a year? then you MUST start it today, this way you'll be much better than the older version of yourself _(who use to think that I'll do it next year)_ 🔥
